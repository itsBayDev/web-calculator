# Web calculator

This is a simple web calculator I made as part of a tiny school project that can perform basic arithmetic operations and plot functions with HTML, CSS, Javascript & [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

You can try the calculator [here](https://itsbaydev.github.io/web-calculator/).

## Features

### Numerical calculator
- Basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Decimal point: `.`
- Percentage calculation: `%`
- Square root: `√`
- Clear and backspace: `C`, `⟵`
- Opposite sign with the `o` key
- Chain operations on the result
- Keyboard support (numbers, operators...)
- Error handling (division by zero, wrong domain...)

### Graphing calculator
- Function input
- Expression parsing & sanitization
- Feedback on expression syntax
- Plotting of the function
- Transitions between plots

### Dark mode
You can switch between light and dark mode with a nice transition by clicking the icon in the top right corner.

## Usage

### Numerical calculator
You can use the calculator by clicking the buttons with your mouse or by using your keyboard. The calculator supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

- Numbers: `0-9`
- Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `o` (opposite sign)
- Decimal point: `.`
- Delete: `Backspace`
- Clear: `Escape`

### Graphing calculator
You can input a function in the input field and it will be plotted on the graph.  
The calculator supports the following syntax:

- constants: `E`, `PI`
- any amout of `x` variables
- any number (integer or decimal)
- any amount of pairs of parentheses
- basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- usual functions: `abs`, `ceil`, `cos`, `exp`, `floor`, `log`, `max`, `min`, `pow`, `round`, `sign`, `sin`, `sqrt`, `tan`

## Areas for improvement

- [ ] Prevent the display from overflowing
- [ ] Plot functions in a worker to avoid freezing the UI
- [ ] Make the precision of the graph adjustable by the user
- [ ] (hard) Find indefinite points to avoid trying to trace them
